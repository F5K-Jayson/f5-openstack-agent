You can run the F5 LBaaS agent on any host that has the Neutron python libraries installed. Multiple F5 LBaaS agents can run simultaneously on the same host.

We recommend you install the agent on the Neutron Controller or Gateway node, as both contain the appropriate libraries by default. You can also install the agent on a dedicated node.
