1. You must deploy the [F5 LBaaS Plug-in]({{ f5-os-lbaasv1/index.html | prepend: site.url }}) before you deploy the agent. 

You must have at least one BIG-IP cluster, or 'device service group \(DSG\)' set up before you deply the agent. 

**Tip:** Make note of the IP addresses and credentials for the devices in the cluster; you'll need to enter them in the agent's config file.
